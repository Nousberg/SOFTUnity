SOFTUnity
An AI-generated open source soft-body physics simulation for Unity



Fast and painless 3D soft body integration in Unity Engine.

✨ Features
Position Based Dynamics (PBD) — Stable real-time soft body simulation
Verlet Integration — Velocity-free physics with natural damping
Bowyer-Watson Tetrahedralization — Automatic internal mesh generation
Visual Mesh Deformation — Real-time mesh updates from physics
Constraint System — Connect soft bodies together or anchor to world
ScriptableObject Storage — Edit physics mesh in editor, preserve at runtime
Scene Editor Tools — Visual node/beam manipulation with handles

🚀 Quick Start
csharp
// 1. Add component to any GameObject with MeshFilter
[RequireComponent(typeof(MeshFilter), typeof(MeshRenderer))]
public class MySoftBody : MonoBehaviour
{
    public AdvancedVolumetricSoftBody softBody;
}
// 2. Create SoftBodyTruss asset: Assets → Create → Physics → Soft Body Truss
// 3. Assign truss to component
// 4. Click "Generate from Mesh" in inspector
// 5. Hit Play!
🎛️ Inspector Tabs
Tab	Description
Truss	Statistics, generation settings, danger zone (clear buttons)
Nodes	Edit selected nodes: mass, pin state
Beams	Edit selected beams: rest length, stiffness
Sets	Create named node groups for constraints
🔗 Constraints
Connect multiple soft bodies or anchor nodes to world space:

csharp
// Add SoftBodyConstraint component
// Set Base Body (target soft body, or null for world anchor)
// Create Links between Node Sets
Constraint Types:

Node → Node — Distance constraint between bodies
Node → World — Pin nodes to initial world position
⚙️ Physics Parameters
Parameter	Description	Default
distanceStiffness	Beam constraint strength	0.8
volumeStiffness	Volume preservation	0.5
damping	Velocity damping	0.99
solverIterations	Constraint solver passes	10
gravity	World gravity	(0, -9.81, 0)
🛠️ Advanced Features
Plasticity
Permanent deformation when stress exceeds threshold:

csharp
plasticityThreshold = 0.1f;  // 10% stretch before plastic deformation
plasticityRate = 0.5f;       // How fast rest length adapts
maxDeformation = 2.0f;       // Maximum stretch multiplier
Collision
Built-in sphere-based collision with Unity colliders:

csharp
enableCollision = true;
collisionRadius = 0.05f;
friction = 0.3f;
